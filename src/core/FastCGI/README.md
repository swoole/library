FastCGI is an open extension to CGI that provides high performance for all Internet applications without the penalties

Many modern web-servers such as nginx, apache, lighthttpd, etc are communicating with PHP via FCGI. So, this protocol
is well known and used in many applications. More detailed information about the protocol is available here here:
