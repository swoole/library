/**
 * An HTTP/2 client that multiplexes requests from many coroutines over one shared connection.
 *
 * A single recv-loop coroutine reads every response off the connection and routes it to the
 * requesting coroutine by stream ID. The connection is established on demand and re-established
 * transparently after a teardown (the pre-send health check only verifies the local socket state,
 * not peer liveness); a heartbeat checker closes it after a period without requests.
 *
 * The connection is owned by that machinery: the frame-level API inherited from the base class
 * (recv(), read(), write(), goaway()) is disabled and throws, and send() must not be called
 * directly — the response to a stream that request() did not register would be parked forever,
 * and the connection could then never idle-close. Use request().
 *
 * Besides the settings understood by the underlying client, set() accepts two options that borrow
 * Swoole\Server's heartbeat vocabulary — here they govern the client's own outbound connection:
 * - heartbeat_check_interval: seconds between two idle checks (default: 3; non-positive values
 *   fall back to the default)
 * - heartbeat_idle_time: seconds without a new request after which a connection with no in-flight
 *   requests is closed automatically (default: 10); a non-positive value disables idle closing, in
 *   which case the connection stays open until close() is called or the peer closes it
 * Both are read when the heartbeat checker starts; changing them on a client whose checker is
 * already running takes effect only after the next close().
